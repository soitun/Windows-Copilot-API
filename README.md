# Windows Copilot API: a free LLM API powered by Microsoft Copilot

![Windows Copilot API — a free, OpenAI-compatible API for your Microsoft Copilot account](assets/windows-copilot-api-banner.png)

**Using your own Microsoft Copilot account.** No API key, no credits, no paid plan: it turns the free chat at [copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com) into an API you can call from code.

You can use it in two ways:

- 🐍 **As a Python library:** just call `client.chat("Hi")`. Supports streaming and multi-turn conversations.
- 🔌 **As a local OpenAI-compatible API:** runs a server at `http://localhost:8000/v1` that speaks the OpenAI format, so the official `openai` SDK (and any OpenAI-compatible app) works as a drop-in, with `localhost` in place of OpenAI.

You sign in once in a browser with your Microsoft **or Google** account; your session is saved and refreshed automatically after that.

> **Unofficial project.** Not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft. It automates the consumer Copilot web experience for personal use, so use it responsibly and within Microsoft's terms.

## Why use this?

- **Free:** uses your normal signed-in Copilot, no API billing.
- **Drop-in OpenAI replacement:** point any OpenAI client at `localhost` and it just works.
- **Works everywhere you're signed in:** the signed-in path works even in regions where *anonymous* Copilot is blocked (e.g. India).
- **Streaming + conversations:** token-by-token output and multi-turn threads addressed by `conversation_id`.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.9+**
- A **Microsoft account** (the free one you use for Copilot is fine)
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

---

## Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Windows-Copilot-API
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment**

On **macOS / Linux**:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

On **Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

> On Windows you may need to allow script execution once: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`. In `cmd.exe` activate with `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` instead.

**3. Install dependencies and sign in**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the browser Playwright needs (one-time)
playwright install chromium

# Sign in once: a browser opens, log into your Microsoft or Google account
python -m copilot login
```

The browser **closes by itself** once sign-in is detected — you don't need to press Enter or close it manually. After sign-in it sends one short warm-up message that mints the chat token **and** passes Cloudflare's "verify you're human" check in the same step (a brief "finishing setup…" appears, and a tiny throwaway chat lands in your history). If a checkbox shows up, click it in that login window. The steps are logged to `session/login.log` if anything goes wrong. That's it: your session is saved under `session/` (git-ignored, never shared) and reused on every run — so your first request works right away.

> 🛠️ **Run into trouble during setup or your first run?** Head to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section, the bundled diagnostic both *fixes* common issues (captcha/clearance) and *logs* a shareable report.

---

## Run with Docker (optional)

Prefer a container? You can run the OpenAI-compatible server in Docker once you've signed in.

> **Sign in on the host first.** The login step above opens a *visible* browser, which can't run inside the headless container — so run `python -m copilot login` on your host to populate `session/`. The container mounts that folder and reuses the Cloudflare clearance earned on the host. It refreshes the chat token headlessly, but it can't earn *fresh* clearance without a visible browser, so when clearance expires (~30 min) it returns a `503` — re-run `python -m copilot login` on the host to refresh `session/`.

```bash
docker compose up --build
# -> Copilot OpenAI-compatible API on http://localhost:8000
```

The [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) maps port `8000` and bind-mounts your `session/` so the login persists across restarts. Tune `RATE_LIMIT_RPM` / `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` there. To run without Compose, build and pass the same bindings by hand:

```bash
docker build -t windows-copilot-api .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -v "$(pwd)/session:/app/session" windows-copilot-api
```

---

## Usage 1: In Python (no server)

The simplest way if your code is already Python.

```python
from copilot import CopilotClient

client = CopilotClient()                 # loads your signed-in session

# Get a full reply
reply = client.chat("Say hello in one short sentence.")
print(reply.text)

# Continue the SAME conversation — pass the id back
reply2 = client.chat("And now in French?", reply.conversation_id)
print(reply2.text)

# Stream the answer as it's typed
for chunk in client.stream("Tell me a short joke"):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

`chat()` returns the full text plus a `conversation_id`; pass that id back to keep the thread going, or omit it to start fresh. `stream()` yields the reply piece by piece.

---

## Usage 2: As an OpenAI-compatible server

Start a local server that speaks the OpenAI API, so existing OpenAI tools and SDKs work unchanged.

```bash
python app.py
# -> Copilot OpenAI-compatible API on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Then point any OpenAI client at it (the API key is required by the SDK but ignored):

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="unused")

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="copilot",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

Or call it with plain HTTP / `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

**Endpoints**

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | Chat (supports `"stream": true` and an optional `"conversation_id"`) |
| `GET`  | `/v1/models` | Lists the single `copilot` model |

> Change the address with env vars: `HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=8080 python app.py`, or run `uvicorn server.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`.

## Command line

```bash
python -m copilot login          # sign in and save the session
python -m copilot ask "Hello!"   # quick one-shot question
```

## Cloudflare clearance (automatic)

Copilot's chat sits behind Cloudflare. Access needs a `cf_clearance` cookie,
earned by passing a "verify you're human" check in a real browser, and it lasts
about half an hour. The bridge handles this for you:

- **At sign-in:** `python -m copilot login` earns clearance as part of the same
  warm-up that mints your token, so your first request works immediately. If
  Cloudflare shows a checkbox, click it in the login window.
- **When it expires:** if a later request hits the gate, the bridge opens a
  browser, passes the check (the checkbox is clicked automatically, or you click
  it if one appears), and retries the request for you. You'll see a short
  `[copilot] clearance: …` progress log, then the answer.

On a trusted connection the check often passes invisibly with no window at all. A
datacenter/VPN IP is stricter and more likely to show the checkbox; a residential
connection clears most reliably.

The **server** never opens a window: when clearance expires it returns a `503`
(`type: "clearance_required"`). Re-clear out of band with `python -m copilot
login`, then retry.

---

## Concurrency & stress test

The server bridges a **single** signed-in Copilot account, and Copilot's chat
socket doesn't tolerate concurrent conversations from one process. So the server
**serializes** upstream calls: parallel HTTP requests queue behind a lock and run
one at a time (see [server/api.py](server/api.py)). This is intentional, and it
means throughput is sequential, not parallel.

You can measure where it breaks with the included stress test, which fires a
batch of simultaneous requests and **doubles the batch size every successful
round** until the first error:

```bash
# Start the server in one terminal
python app.py

# Ramp concurrency in another (1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → …)
python tests/stress.py
python tests/stress.py --max 64 --timeout 120 --url http://localhost:8000
```

**Sample run** (one signed-in account):

| Concurrency | Result | Wall time | Latency (min / median / max) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ✓ all ok | 3.7s | 3.7 / 3.7 / 3.7s |
| 2 | ✓ all ok | 4.6s | 3.4 / 4.6 / 4.6s |
| 4 | ✓ all ok | 8.3s | 3.7 / 6.7 / 8.3s |
| 8 | ✗ 1 failed (`HTTP 502`) | 13.3s | 3.5 / 9.7 / 13.3s |

**Highest fully-successful concurrency: 4.** Wall time roughly doubles each round
while *minimum* latency stays flat (~3.5s) — the signature of a serialized queue:
one request runs immediately, the rest wait their turn. The failure at 8 is an
upstream `502` (Copilot rejecting requests under load), not a server crash or
timeout — so the exact break point is flaky and may vary between runs.

> Takeaway: keep concurrent in-flight requests low (≈ 1–4). This is a personal
> bridge, not a high-throughput gateway — and please don't hammer your account.

---

## Rate limiting

Concurrency (above) is *how many at once*; the **rate limit** is *how many per
minute, sustained*. Microsoft publishes none for consumer Copilot, so the bridge
enforces a self-imposed one with a [token bucket](server/ratelimit.py): it caps
accepted requests per minute and returns a standard `429` + `Retry-After` when
you exceed it. Two env vars tune it:

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RATE_LIMIT_RPM` | `12` | Requests/minute the bridge accepts. `0` disables the limit. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | `4` | How many requests may go back-to-back before pacing kicks in. |

```bash
RATE_LIMIT_RPM=20 RATE_LIMIT_BURST=5 python app.py   # raise it; 0 to disable
```

The default 12 rpm sits safely below the ~15 rpm where a single account starts
seeing upstream `502`s. To find *your* ceiling, run the server with the limiter
off (`RATE_LIMIT_RPM=0`) and push the probe until failures appear:

```bash
python tests/ratelimit.py --rpm 20 --minutes 3
```

**On the client side, use exponential backoff.** Both `429` (bridge limit) and
the occasional `502` (Copilot upstream hiccup) are transient — retry with
growing delays (e.g. 1s, 2s, 4s) and they almost always clear. The official
`openai` SDK does this automatically and honours `Retry-After`; with plain HTTP,
add a few retries yourself.

## Notes & limitations

- **Sign in once, then reuse.** The cached token refreshes automatically; you only re-sign-in if the session fully expires.
- **No daily limit, but be reasonable.** Microsoft doesn't impose a daily chat cap, but please use it in moderation, and don't spam or hammer it with automated bulk requests.
- **One model.** Copilot has no model picker, so the server advertises a single model named `copilot`.
- **Roughly GPT-4 class.** On GPQA Diamond (198 graduate-level questions, closed-book) it scores **40.9%**, which puts it in the GPT-4 family rather than the reasoning tier (o1/o3). Measured with [tests/gpqa_bench.py](tests/gpqa_bench.py).
- **Your session is private.** Everything in `session/` (cookies + token) stays on your machine and is git-ignored.

---

## Troubleshooting

Cloudflare clearance is handled automatically (see above), so most "verify you're
human" issues clear themselves. If a request still fails, run the diagnostic — it
refreshes the session and writes a shareable report.

```bash
python tests/diagnostic.py                # browser capture + report
python tests/diagnostic.py --report-only  # headless/VPS: report only, no browser
```

The default run opens your signed-in browser and asks you to send one short
message. That single action:

- **Refreshes clearance:** it drives a *real* browser on the same
  `session/profile/` the bridge uses, so passing any "verify you're human" check
  earns a fresh `cf_clearance` cookie, then snapshots the session (cookies +
  token) into `session/token.json` for the pure-HTTP driver to adopt.
- **Captures the protocol** to `session/ws_capture.log`. A clean turn goes
  `setOptions` → `send` → `appendText…` → `done`; a `{"event":"challenge",
  "method":"cloudflare",…}` frame means Cloudflare gated the turn.

It also writes `session/diagnostic_report.txt` — environment, the *shape* of your
session (cookie names + token length, never the values), a live chat probe, and
redacted log tails. **Both files are safe to share:** access tokens, cookies,
OAuth codes, and emails are redacted before anything is written. Attach
`diagnostic_report.txt` to a GitHub issue (skim it first) and the cause is
usually obvious.

> On a headless **server/VPS** you can't open a browser, so clearance can't be
> earned there — pass `--report-only`, and do the clearance step on a machine
> with a display (or route traffic through a residential connection, e.g. a
> home-PC exit node), since datacenter IPs are where Cloudflare is strictest.
