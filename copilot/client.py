    anonymous:
        Skip sign-in and talk to Copilot anonymously. Only works where the
        anonymous consumer experience is available (it is geo-blocked in some
        regions, e.g. India). Default ``False`` uses the signed-in session.
    proxy:
        Optional ``scheme://user:pass@host:port`` proxy, applied to both the
        auth refresh and every request.
    max_age:
        Seconds a cached access token is trusted before it is refreshed.
    interactive_clear:
        When a turn is gated behind a Cloudflare Turnstile (expired
        ``cf_clearance``), recover by opening a *visible* browser and refreshing
        clearance there (the checkbox is auto-clicked, or a human clicks it), then
        retry. Default ``True``. Set ``False`` for headless/server use, where a
        :class:`~copilot.driver.ClearanceRequired` error is raised instead of
        popping a window.
    headless_clear:
        Attempt a *headless* clearance refresh before the visible one. Default
        ``False``: headless Turnstile solving is unreliable on low-trust egress
        (VPN/datacenter IPs) and a failed pass can leave a half-cleared state, so
        the dependable path is a visible window. Enable once headless is proven on
